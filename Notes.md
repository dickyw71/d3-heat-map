## To-do
- setup SVG with size based on viewport

- divide the x axis width by the number of years to find the slice width for each year

- Treat X scale as linear not time.

- Choose better colour scale
- Calculate temperature delta
- Tool-tip with Month name, year, temp (base + variance) and temp delta
