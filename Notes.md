## To-do
- setup SVG with size based on viewport

- divide the x axis width by the number of years to find the slice width for each year
- divide the y axis height by the number of months to find the slice height for each month

- ~~Choose better colour scale~~
- ~~Calculate temperature delta~~
- ~~Tool-tip with Month name, year, temp (base + variance) and temp delta~~
- Key showing scale of temperature variance by colour and value

- divide y axis height by 12 (each month) + offset half month height to centre text
append text for each month to left of y axis
